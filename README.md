## Adding Language

Adding a new (app) language to the extension requires updating several areas. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Create Language Locale Files For i18n

- Create a new folder in `public/locales/` with the language code (e.g., `pt` for Portuguese)

- Copy all JSON files from the English reference directory and translate them

**Important**: Keep the same JSON structure and keys as English, only translate the values.

#### 1.1. (Optional) Validate i18n

Run the validation script to ensure all required keys are present:

```bash
npm run i18n:check
```

If validation passes, build and test the extension:

```bash
npm run build
```

Note that the validation script will automatically detect your new language folder and ensure all required files and keys are present!

### 2. Update Application Constants

Add the new language to constant `SUPPORTED_APP_LANGUAGE` in `src/constants/languages.ts`

### 3. Update Content Script

Add the new language and its translation to constant `DICTIONARY` in `src/content-script.ts`

### 4. Update This Doc (`README.md`)

Update `README.md` at [Supported Languages](#supported-languages) section

## Drawbacks (Developer log)

- The AI model takes a while to load responses. We could switch to a lighter model to speed things up, but this might lead to less accurate results in some cases.
- Since the output is AI-generated, each response is unique, so the results aren‚Äôt consistent every time.
- Generating responses uses tokens, which means if the app goes into production, it won‚Äôt‚Äîand shouldn‚Äôt‚Äîbe free. The reality is, users will often seek out free alternatives, so the business model for this kind of app isn‚Äôt guaranteed to succeed.
